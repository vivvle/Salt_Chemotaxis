Chemosensation is the ability to sense chemical signal in the environment that can alter behavior and responses. 

The project focuses on studying to which degree the guanylyl cyclase gene (gcy) family and its signaling pathway are conserved between free-living and host-associated nematode species.

The folders for this project is organized as the following:
